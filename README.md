## 📌 Why I Built This Project

The main motivation behind Skyline Vista was to create a real-world MERN stack-based application that:
- Solves practical problems related to property listing and booking.
- Demonstrates user roles and authorization systems.
- Integrates real-time earnings/statistics features for agents.
- Helps improve full-stack development skills including frontend UI, backend logic, and database design.
- Implements secure payment gateway integration for smooth transactions.
